A module is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details and exposes a public API so it can be easily loaded and used by other code.


In JavaScript, modules should ideally allow us to:

abstract code: to delegate functionality to specialised libraries so that we don't have to understand the complexity of their actual implementation
encapsulate code: to hide code inside the module if we don't want the code to be changed
reuse code: to avoid writing the same code over and over again
manage dependencies: to easily change dependencies without rewriting our code
