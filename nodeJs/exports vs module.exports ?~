Both of them are references to the same and empty object at the beggining.

NodeJs does lot of thing to our .js files and one fo the importent is wrapping our files.

we can consider theat export is just a little helper of module.exports.

if you want your module to be of a specific object type use module.exports if you want your module to be a typical module instance use exports

if you overwrite module.exports with exports or anything it will fail.

initially exports and module.exports point at same empty object . we can add properties to this blank object by using exports and module.exports .

if a developer unintentionally or intentionally re-assign module.exports to a different object or different data structure then any properties added to the original module.exports object.
