A module is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details and exposes a public API so it can be easily loaded and used by other code.


In JavaScript, modules should ideally allow us to:

abstract code: to delegate functionality to specialised libraries so that we don't have to understand the complexity of their actual implementation

encapsulate code: to hide code inside the module if we don't want the code to be changed

reuse code: to avoid writing the same code over and over again

manage dependencies: to easily change dependencies without rewriting our code





Module formats
A module format is the syntax we can use to define a module.

Before EcmaScript 6 or ES2015, JavaScript did not have an official syntax to define modules. Therefore, smart developers came up with various formats to define modules in JavaScript.

Some of the most widely adapted and well known formats are:

Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
CommonJS
Universal Module Definition (UMD)
System.register
ES6 module format
