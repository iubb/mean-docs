Mongoose is a MONGODB object modeling tool designed to work in asynchronous envirnment.

Here we can define structure of document based on your requirements and can set validations.
And we can also define statics methods on model and instance methods on documents and hooks called middleware.



firstname: {
	type: String,
	required: 'Firstname is required',
	maxlength: [20, 'Firstname cannot be more then {MAXLENGTH} characters.']
},


enum: {
	values: ['A','B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
	message: '{VALUE} is not a valid role for user'
},

email: {
	type: String,
	lowercase: true,
	trim: true,
	unique: 'The Email address you have entered already exists.',
	uniqueCaseInsensitive:true,
	required: 'E-mail is required',
	validate: {
		validator: function(email) {
			return /^([\w-\.+]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4})?$/.test(email);
		},
		message: '{VALUE} is not a valid email address'
	}
},
